# DESCRIPTION OF FIONA'S PORTFOLIO WEBSITE:
# Purpose:
To build and deploy a website that will show my skills not only as a developer using HTML and CSS, but also to showcase my educational and professional skills.  The website will allow users to see my personality, but also be able to click through to my github and linkedin accounts to view further information relating to my work and career. <br>

# Functionality / features:
This website has four pages of content which can be toggled via the nav bar.
<br>
The home page is responsive for mobile with the use of media queries.  Media queries enable to quote to move between the header image and the main content section.  A media query also enables the nav bar to move from the centre main area up to the rop right below the header image.
<br>
The home page quote features "lightening" animation, however this is only functional using Firefox.
<br>
Each page contains logo click-throughs direct to mylinked profile and github account set in the footer. 
<br>
Content includes about-me info, work experience and qualifications as well as a submittable email form for anyone seeking to contact me.
<br>

# Target audience:
Primary target: head hunters
Secondary target: those looking for further information on me <br>

# Tech stack (e.g. html, css, deployment platform, etc):
The technology used to build my portfolio website is HTML and CSS.
<br>
<br>


# DESIGN DOCUMENTATION INCLUDING:
# Design process:
Pinterest was my inspiration of this page.<br>
I like crisp, clean and calming colours, so spent time looking at white and feathers.<br>
The feathers add an element of texture, but softness which complements the calming colours. <br>
The colours selected were chalky colours that are somewhat muted, in line with the calming theme. <br>

# Wireframes:

![page3 and page4](/statics/docs/wireframe2.png)


# Personal logo (optional):
No logo included in the website. <br>
Instead, I opted to use an image of myself on each page.

# Usability considerations:
The home page has been made to be responsive between desktop and mobile with the use of media queries.
<br>
However, due to lack of time, this functionality has not carried across to the remaining three pages, therefore the nav bar falls at various sections on each page and does not manipulate for smaller screen readibility.
<br>
The home page also has animation, however this is not compatible with Chrome and needs to be viewed in Firefox.

# DETAILS OF PLANNING PROCESS INCLUDING:
# Project plan & timeline:
Pre-work included the creation of a mood board via Pinterest and starting to think about wireframes in Figma <br>
Day 1: finalising wireframes and getting teacher approval to build. Also populating Trello <br>
Day 2: build the HTML and CSS for page 1 and page 2<br>
Day 3: build the HTML and CSS for page 3 and page 4<br>
Day 4: test and fix.  Complete necessary admin<br>
Finalise: git hub, deploying and handing in assignment for grading. <br>

# SHORT ANSWER Q&A:
# Describe key events in the development of the internet from the 1980s to today (max. 150 words):
In the 1980s, research at CERN in Switzerland by British computer scientist Tim Berners-Lee resulted in the World Wide Web, linking hypertext documents into an information system, accessible from any node on the network. <br>
In the early 1980s the NSF funded the establishment for national supercomputing centers at several universities, and provided interconnectivity in 1986 with the NSFNET project, which also created network access to the supercomputer sites in the United States from research and education organizations. <br>
The very high-speed Backbone Network Service (vBNS) came on line in April 1995 as part of a National Science Foundation (NSF) sponsored project to provide high-speed interconnection between NSF-sponsored supercomputing centers and select access points in the United States. The network was engineered and operated by MCI Telecommunications under a cooperative agreement with the NSF. <br>

Today the Internet continues to grow, driven by ever greater amounts of online information, commerce, entertainment, and social networking.<br>



# Define and describes the relationship between fundamental aspects of the internet such as: domains, web servers, DNS, and web browsers (max. 150 words):
Domain is the unique name of your website such as fionatolliday.com. The server or usually called as web server is an actual place where your website files are hosted. They are identified by IP addresses. <br>

The domain name system (DNS) is the way that internet domain names are located and translated into internet protocol (IP) addresses. ... For example, if someone types fionatolliday.com into a web browser, a server behind the scenes will map that name to the IP address 206.19.49.149. <br>

Web browsers and servers communicate via TCP/IP. Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is the standard application protocol on top of TCP/IP supporting web browser requests and server responses. Web browsers also rely on DNS to work with URLs. <br>





# Reflect on one aspect of the development of internet technologies and how it has contributed to the world today (max. 150 words):
Google Maps is the most widely used mapping app, with more than 1 billion people around the world using Google Maps each month.  This app has changed the way we move through local and foreign cities each day. Not only can google maps provide us with route planning tools, but it can also give us real-time times to destination.  All Android phones that have location services turned on and all iPhones that have Google Maps open, send anonymous bits of data back to Google, which helps determine how traffic is flowing.  So when we’re sitting in traffic, we’re sending Google information alerting people not to make the same mistake we made. <br>
