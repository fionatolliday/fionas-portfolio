            <p>Not until my 30â€™s did i have faith in my creative abilities.
                    Until this time, my career focused on the strategic business side of advertising and marketing. <br>
                    
                    When my girls were toddlers, I decided to teach myself to sew.  Using my grandmas vintage Pfaff machine alongside Pinterest inspiration, I quickly discovered a passion for creating little girls dresses and taught myself to sew them. <br>
                    
                    Not long after, I explored the world of coding and found enjoyment in solving the puzzles that are coding.  <br>
                    In 2018 I was lucky enough to be one of three women selected for the MYOB DevelopHer scholarship which saw me thrown into the Coder Academy fast track bootcamp before joining the MYOB Future Makers Academy on the grad program.
